## Technique Notes

**B00 — Cold Open** `ClaudeComposerAsk`
  Kore introduces: one logo, 47 paths, every Remotion move.

**B01 — Spring Entrance** `spring({ damping: 22, stiffness: 180, mass: 0.9 })`
  Default spring. Mark enters as one unit. Nothing special — that's the point.

**B02 — Overshoot Spring** `spring({ damping: 4, stiffness: 400, mass: 1.5 })`
  Low damping + high stiffness = bounce. Squash/stretch at peak. Energy read.

**B03 — Per-Path Stagger** `4-frame offset × 47 paths`
  47 paths enter in sequence. The cascade is richer than any wordmark can deliver.

**B04 — Draw-On Stroke** `strokeDashoffset → fillProgress`
  SPARK terracotta outline traces, then ink fill floods. Corner fidelity note: complex paths.

**B05 — Mask Reveal** `clipPath: inset → inset round (iris)`
  Left-to-right wipe first half, iris close second half.

**B06 — Scale Zoom** `interpolate(8→1)` linear, then `spring` bezier
  Two easing comparisons in one beat — which one reads as a camera move?

**B07 — Rotation** `rotateZ(-180→0)` entrance, `rotateZ(slow hold)`
  Near-square mark: rotation lands differently than on a wide wordmark.

**B08 — Skew And Shear** `skewX(-18deg)` lean then release
  Lean-in, hold, release. Italic read vs. distortion threshold.

**B09 — Opacity Through Blur** `blur(24→0)` + `opacity(0→1)`
  Materialise from soft focus. If you're looking for the blur it's working.

**B10 — Color Interpolation** *(treatment beat — palette violation labeled)*
  Per-path color sweeps ink→terracotta→ink. The exception that proves the accent law.

**B11 — Kinetic Scatter** `translate(outward) → spring(back)`
  47 paths explode from center, spring home. 47 vectors = richer than text scatter.

**B12 — Glitch Slices** `6 slices × translateX offsets → snap`
  Horizontal slices offset ~8 frames then snap clean. Correction vs. decoration.

**B13 — Trail Echo** `5 ghost copies × lag offset`
  Low-opacity copies trail the fast slide across frame, mark settles center.

**B14 — Noise Wobble** `sin(frame + path_phase) × wobbleAmt → settles`
  Per-path sine jitter, amplitude decays to zero. Alive vs. broken read.

**B15 — Elastic Physics** `spring({ damping: 5, stiffness: 180, mass: 1.2 })`
  Drop → squash (scaleY) → rebound. Config is the whole design decision.

**B16 — Path Cascade** `47 paths rain from translateY(-800) staggered`
  Waterfall entry, paths in order. With 47 elements the texture is distinctive.

**B17 — Card Flip** `rotateY(0→180)` in perspective, front/back faces
  INK front, SPARK back. The hold after flip earns or wastes its frame time.

**B18 — Shadow Play** `shadow offset grows → spring back to zero`
  Offset-layer shadow animates independently then rejoins. Brand depth move.

**B19 — Composer Summon** `SPARK flash at send → mark materialises`
  Terracotta burst on the send action, logo springs in from nothing.

**B20 — Exit Family** Three exits: shrink-spin, blur-out, mask-close
  Three ways to leave. Only one works to cut to black on.

**B21 — Your Turn** `ClaudeComposerAsk` handoff prompt
  Suggest: Per-Path Stagger, Kinetic Scatter, Draw-On, Elastic, Mask Reveal.

**B22 — Outro** `ClaudeTitleOutro`
